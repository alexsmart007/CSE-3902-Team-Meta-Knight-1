CODE REVIEW of Sprint-3-Owen-Jumping by Owen Tishenkel 10-12-2021
Owen Huston’ Code:
Left and Right Jumping Link States: Having a limit on the amount of time you can hold a jump is smart. 
I’m not sure how much I like that the timer is being passed into the state, maybe we should make a json 
file that holds the speed and jump time limits for players and enemies, it would allow us to implement jumping 
enemies later on as well as make the code be subject to a single point of change rather than having to alter any 
creation of the Jumping State. There are a couple of comments scattered around but I feel like this would benefit 
from having more, and I having trouble understanding this one in the jump() method: “if(jumpHold) prevents us from 
pressing letting go then holding jump”. I like the stopMoving() method, good way of doing it and the switching back 
to normal link when link is falling makes it so jumps when y velocity is negative are impossible, though I suspect 
that jumps when y-velocity is positive are still possible because I see nothing disallowing it.

Controllers: Holdable key mappings is a good distinguishment to have from normal key mappings and lowers the 
complexity of normal key mappings due to not having to modify it to allow for the hold mechanic.

Overall: I think the Jumping States need to be modified a bit, adding more comments, preempting the infinite jumping bug 
possibility if I’m not just missing something, the json file idea is something to add at a later date though.
