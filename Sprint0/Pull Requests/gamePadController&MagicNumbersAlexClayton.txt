CODE REVIEW of SPRINT4-magicNumber - gamePadController “ by Alex Clayton 11/3/21
IGamePadController: Unnecessary and duplicate code. Use IController instead since 
they essentially do the same thing.

ControllerLoader: Adds SetUpPlayerGamePad function. Straightforward and looks good to me. 
ReadPlayerButtons is just a reader for the buttons. I almost guarantee we can combine 
this with the ReadPlayerKeys method using delegates I think. For now it is working code 
but can be revised to eliminate the duplicated code code smells.

GamePadBindings.xml: Looks good. Just sets up XML stuff to load in the gamepad.

GamePadController.cs Looks good. Again is duplicate code from the KeyboardController 
class, but this works for now. There might be some issues if we were to use a gamepad 
and the keyboard at the same time, but I will test this when I get home and can use 
both.

Mario.cs: Adds the gamepad controller as an instance to be setup. Also adds gamepad to 
the update list.

MAGIC NUMBERS: Overall this is good. I really like the idea of having “GameUtilities” 
have everything, but it makes some of this hard to read so it might be a better idea 
to just store everything locally within the appropriate class file. This way, we can 
easily edit and change values. I like how you organized the file based on what class 
they are in and I think you gave detailed names, which is good. Good job overall!

Overall: The magic numbers is a really good change and will be sustainable for the 
future. It makes updating values much easier since you can update all instances at 
once rather than having multiple spots, and it also makes our code much more readable 
since we don’t have random numbers floating around. The gamepad controls should work 
but I will test that when I get home and see if there are any conflicts between the 
gamepad and controller.
