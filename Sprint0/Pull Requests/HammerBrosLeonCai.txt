CODE REVIEW OF Sprint-5-Owen3 by Leon Cai 12/2 2021

CollisionData.xml: add collison instance between hammers and Mario.
CDamagePlayer.cs: Add corresponding commands for the collison instance.
Content: add sprite for hammer bro and thumbs 
Enemy.cs: In Enemy.cs class, instead of setting facing direction in each moveRight(), moveLeft() method, The direction 
issue handles by setDirection method which reduces duplicate code. The payoff is that in enemy state classes, we need 
to call the enemy class to set the direction.

HammerBroNormalState.cs: Good job! I really like the way setting the waitingtime of throwing hammer to become random 
which makes the game more challenging. Also, without using the enemy AI, in the update(), it is smart to keep track of 
Mario position to determine the face direction of the enemy.
