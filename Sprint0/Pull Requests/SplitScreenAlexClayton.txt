CODE REVIEW of Sprint 4 - Kaejot- Split-Screen by Alex Clayton 11/5/21:
KeyboardBindings.xml: Fixes velocity transfer bug. Good fix and makes it so you can 
hold movement rather than continuously updating it.

LeftFacingJumpingMario.cs: Changes X velocity to be the same as everywhere else. 
Changes MoveRight to take in the X velocity instead of 6 to make velocity transfer 
around. Update: Makes sure that if mario is not holding jump midair, velocity is 
still transferred. 

LeftFacingMovingMario.cs:  Changes velocity vector to match other instances, -4f for 
movement instead of -6f. Same with jump. UpBounce: Makes sure that if mario is falling 
and that he doesn’t clip into anything outside of his movement box. Good change and 
probably fixed a bug that we didn’t see yet. 

DownBounce: Same as above, prevents some of the clipping issues into walls.

LeftFacingStaticMario.cs: Stopmovinghorizontal: Sets value instead of changing nothing. 
Good change that makes sure stopping movement works as intended. Same is done for 
vertical.

RightFacingJumpingMario.cs: Same as above
RightFacingMovingMario.cs: Same as above
RightFacingStaticMario.cs: Same as above

Overall: Good bug fixes, relatively minor changes involving collision but it fixes 
velocity transfer in midair and potentially prevented a future bug we would have where 
mario does not stop moving when he is supposed to. Sustainable for the future.
