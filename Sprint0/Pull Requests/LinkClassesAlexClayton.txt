CODE REVIEW of Sprint 2-Jared by Alex Clayton9/23/21:

Link.cs: I like the idea of OnStateChange and the HealthStateMachine and currentState both are good too! 
GetSpriteID: This makes sense but why would you want the string for Link’s state when we’ll just update it based on interacting with an upgrade/taking damage ? 
It just seems like an extra step but I’m sure there’s merit to doing it in some way.
LinkHealthStateMachine: Since LoZ isn’t like mario and Link has hearts rathers than concrete states,
im assuming the full/half/none refer to full health/damaged/dead. I think the “Linkhealth.half” case will
need to be changed since if link takes damage well he is on, say, 2 hearts, he won’t be dead in most cases,
but according to this code it would change him to the dead health state. 
RightFacingStaticLink: This looks good to me.  Same with the other facing states.
KeyboardController: Keyboard controller was already fixed in another version of Sprint2.
Game0.cs: Good changes, just initializes the Link and adds him to the update list.
We can probably do this in SpriteFactory or elsewhere though but we’ll see as we refactor Game0.
