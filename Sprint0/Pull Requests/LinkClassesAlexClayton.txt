CODE REVIEW of sprint2_Leon by Alex Clayton 10/1/21:
downAttackLink.cs: setting attack as a Boolean wouldn’t work out. The sword beam idea is good under TakeDamage()
but that depends on the link state machine, which this also doesn’t have a connection to.
downLink.cs: I like using a global constant variable for movement. That’s a good way to avoid magic numbers.
downUseItemLink.cs: Same as other files but the useItem() function has code. It would be better if on useItem(), 
Link’s animation was just updated, so this class is redundant.
leftAttackLink.cs: Same as down attack link
leftLink.cs: Same as other links. 
leftUseItemLink.cs: Same ^
rightAttackLink.cs: Same ^

Overall: We didn’t end up going with this code since another pushed state machine worked better, 
but some ideas here were still valid. The sprite machine used here was the old kind and would still work here, 
but they were done in a good way. I like the idea of using a global constant variable within the code and that 
is probably the best idea here. Code smells with repeated code which could be handled in less cases with states.
