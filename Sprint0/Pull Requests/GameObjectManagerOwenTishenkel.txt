CODE REVIEW of Sprint-3-Jared by Owen Tishenkel 10-12-2021
Jared Israel’s Code:

GameObjectManager: Looks good through I think GameObject go in the method bodies 
should be changed to gameObject or something similar to allow for on sight recognition 
of what it is even without taking a glance at the type. My gut instinct is that it also 
needs some one-job comments, the methods are pretty self-explanatory, but I think documentation 
of intended use for each one would help in implementation rather than just going off of name and 
code alone.

IGameObject: Pretty much perfect, one-job comments are less important here due to how simple 
the methods should be, but I lean towards having one-job comments even when they aren’t fully 
necessary.

Implementation of GameObjectManager throughout code: Replaces 2 line of code in many places with 
one line and the ability to be able to call positions from the GameObjectManager is going to be 
very useful
All and all I'm down to have this pushed, and my main issues have to do with making sure with have 
more in-code documentation to make it easier for the graders and for any one of us trying to 
implement it
