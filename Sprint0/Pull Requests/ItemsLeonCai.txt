CODE REVIEW of Item classes by Leon Cai 10/23/21
Star.cs: The code is really easy to read. One potential problem is that in the  public Star(String itemName, Vector2 position), you use  
this.SetItem(itemName) to initialize the ItemName and ItemSprite, but you did  this.ItemName = itemName again inside the  public 
Star(String itemName, Vector2 position) which basically set the ItemName twice with the same vaule. I think the   
this.ItemName = itemName should be deleted.

Also, for the future sprint, we could add the collect() abstract class in the IItem interface for the scoring system.

FireFlower.cs: same as Star.cs
Mushroom.cs: same as Star.cs

Overall: Good
