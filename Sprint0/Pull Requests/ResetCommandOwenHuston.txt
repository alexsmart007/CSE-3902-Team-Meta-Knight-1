CODE REVIEW of Sprint2ResetCommand by Owen Huston 9/28/21:
CReset: calls execute on all the reset commands.  As our project gets bigger we may need a list of reset commands.
CResetPlayer/CResetItem/CResetEmeny/CResetBlock: creates a new instance of each object.  Nearly duplicated code here that might be able to be narrowed down to one method in the future.

Overall: This reset works.
Future reworks: We may be able to rework this to have a reset method on every gameobject.  then loop through each gameobject calling reset, since each gameobject already knows its initial state.
Another idea could be to pass CReset the gameobject to reset then use reflection to create a new instance of the object.
