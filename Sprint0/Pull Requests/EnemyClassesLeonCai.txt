CODE REVIEW of PULL request #38 of Alex Contreras by Leon Cai 10/1/21 (sprint2)

Enemy.cs: It is good to change the enemy "enemy1" to have the actual name of it so the client could understand our code better.

EnemyStateMachine.cs: Since the animation for sprint 2 do not need sprites for enemy get attacked, so it is good to make the getfiring() into comment for now, but make sure to make comments on it so we could change it for the future sprints.Also, changing Enemy1, Enemy2, and Enemy3 to the acutal name of enemy is great.
In the preEnemy() and nextEnemy() methods, the switch cases is not the best idea here since it reminds me the duplicate code of the code smell. I think it is better to make those enemies in to an enum.

DataSheet.json: It is really great to set all the sprites data into a single file so we could load the whole sprites once. This calls on the decoupling professor Kirby mentioned a lot during the class.

Time to complete the review: 20 minutes.
