CODE REVIEW of Sprint 4 â€“Jared - Sprint-4-Pause-Version2 by Leon Cai 11/12/21:

CTogglePauseGame.cs: Having a Command class for execute pause can enhance readability.

KeyboardBindings.xml: Just adding another key to the keyboard controller

Game0: using pauseScreen class and initialize the pause class here is better than just use the 
boolean isPaused becuase the game does not need to know such details about the state of the 
class. The pause class is the one needed to handle that. Smart way to use the pauseScreen.isPaused 
to control whether the game update GameObjectManager and HUD, but the potential problem is that 
the keyboard inputs other than pause key P are still allowed. The bug is that in the game pause 
state, player still could use A, D to change direction, and R to reset. 

PauseScreen.cs:The class is easy to read. The class only draws the Pause on the screen and freeze 
the game which is what exactly the pause class should do. 

Good Job!
