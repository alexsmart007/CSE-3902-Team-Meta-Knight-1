CODE REVIEW of working camera by Leon Cai 10/23/21
ICamera: Good way to decouple the code by using interfaces to get the ScreenWidth and SCreenHeight. I was trying to do all of that in the camera class.
Camera.cs: It is a good idea to add camera to the Mario update so that the camera is 
actually inside the Mario class and can follow the movement of Mario which solves the 
bug I previously faced. Also, using if else to reset the camera to avoid extreme conditions 
is what I did not think about before.

Game0: The key thing that why my camera does not work is that I did not add the camera to 
the gameObjectManager so the camera is fixed at the position where the Mario sprite initialized. 

Overall: Good
