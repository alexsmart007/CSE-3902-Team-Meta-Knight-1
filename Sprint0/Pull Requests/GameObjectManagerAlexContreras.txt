CODE REVIEW of Sprint 3 - Jared- Game Object Manager by Alex Contreras 10/14/21:

GameObjectManager: Good implementation of the manager, iterating through the lists, however, the variable 
"go" may create confusion as it's not directly and immediately obvious.

We might want to have detectCollisions call a class that handles all the detection of a collision, as it 
might need its own methods and abstractions to implement. I agree with creating the datasheet and map manager 
type and passing info into them. 

Enemy: I don't know if we need to have a set for the Position, though I can see the usefulness in being able 
to set the enemy position at any time, it isn't something that would necessarily be triggered in my opinion.

Game0: For the future, I wouldn't comment out any code we aren't going to use but actually delete it, if we 
need to refer back to how we had working code earlier we can access the Sprint 2, no need to needlessly add 
lines of code that only worsen the readability the code.

OVERALL: Overall the code seems to be good, no major issues here, just some things to add here and there.
