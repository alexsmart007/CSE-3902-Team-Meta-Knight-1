CODE REVIEW of Sprint-4-JumpGlitchFix â€œ by Alex Clayton 11/3/21:
GameObjectManager: Still need to decouple collision from GOM. 
But this fix moves a game object rectangle to being created only 
when the block is not null rather than always.

LeftFacingJumpingMario: Sets a velocity cap on jumping. This is a good 
idea but im not sure if this is how it should be executed since it will require 
velocity to be updated every time. Rather, could we create an equation where the max 
result would equal 16? So that way the cap is constructed mathematically and can be 
consistent across all of movement.

RightFacingJumpingMario: Same thing as LeftFacingJumpingMario.

Overall: Good changes. LeftFacingJumpingMario is sustainable for now but may need 
to be changed, but it fixes the jump glitch that we previously had so it is good 
working code.
