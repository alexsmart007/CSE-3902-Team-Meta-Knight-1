CODE REVIEW of Sprint2ResetCommand by Alex Clayton 9/28/21:

Creset: Combines all the reset commands and works when the user calls Reset. There is duplicated code among all of these files, but doing this code abstracts the code within the CReset itself. 
CResetBlock: Replaces the existing block with a new one.
CResetEnemy: Replaces the existing Enemy with a new one.
CResetItem: Replaces the items with a new instance of item, resetting everything.
CResetPlayer: Looks good. Replaces the existing Link with a new Link, which will reset his state and any values associated. Probably the best way to do it.
Overall: Looks good. If this doesnâ€™t work it should be easy to debug.
