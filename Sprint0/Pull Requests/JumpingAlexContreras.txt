CODE REVIEW of Sprint 3 - Owen - Jumping by Alex Contreras 10/13/21:

CPlayerJump: This goes along with all the code, but we really should change the player object from link to 
Mario for readability.

Jumping Classes: In LeftFacingJumpingLink, in terms of readability we should change the comment "if(jumpHold) 
prevents us from pressing letting go then holding jump" to "prevents double jump" as it makes more sense and 
is clearer. 

    Better code management would be to get rid of the if-else at lines 46-53; and instead just have 
"jumpHold= jumpTimer> 0;"

    Good maintainability with using OnStateChange and jumpTimer to be able to extend the jumping class if 
need be in the future.

RegisterHoldableKey: Love this idea to have the holdable key register, as it will be useful outside of the 
context of jumping. 

DataSheet: Again for readability sake should really change all the datasheet sprite names from Link to Mario, 
and trade out the Sprite Sheet, and update the sprites. 

OVERALL: Overall the code seems to be good, no major issues here, just some things to add here and there.
