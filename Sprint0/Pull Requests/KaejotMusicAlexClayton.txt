CODE REVIEW of Sprint 4  Kaejot Music by Alex Clayton 11/11/21:

CReset.cs: Adds the music player as something new to reset, good change and instantly 
readable.

Content.mgcb: Adds music
Overall: New music was added (yay) and music now resets when the level is restarted. 
Very readable code and accessible to future upgrades. Good to merge.

Overall: Good code and music
