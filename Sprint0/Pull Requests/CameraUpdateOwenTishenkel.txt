CODE REVIEW of Sprint-5-Sprint-5-OwenCameraUpdate by Owen Tishenkel 12/3/21:

CReset.cs: Adjusting the reset command to reset the camera to a cinematic camera until the object it is following 
hits the ground is a change that simplifies many internal camera manipulations that were done in flag mario.

Game0: Building off the current level when initializing rather than the game utilities initial level

LevelData: Changing to falling mario for level 2, simple change already planned for
GameObjectManager: Removing magic numbers, good change.

Mario.cs/Rightfacingflagmario: removing the camera reset and camera switch from mario to shift to cReset, already 
talked about it

GameUtilities: Removing Current level from it, makes sense bc we have to update that and we should never update 
anything in game utilities
