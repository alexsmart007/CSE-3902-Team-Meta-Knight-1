CODE REVIEW of Sprint-5-NewSoundsAndGameOver by Owen Huston 10/18/21:

DefaultHUD: I like the new formatting it looks alot cleaner now.

GameOverScreen: I think soundInfo.StopLoopedSound and soundInfo.PlaySound can both be 
moved to the constructor instead of draw since draw is called every frame and we don't 
need to stop and play sound every frame.

Item: Added sounds to items, looks good.

DataSheet: Lots of new sprites, love to see it.

GameUtilites: currentLevel should probably be renamed to something like "level1" because it is a 
static int. While our currentLevel might be changing throughout the game currentLevel in GameUtilites 
would still be 1 because it is static.
