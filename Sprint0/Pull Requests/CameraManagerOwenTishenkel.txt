CODE REVIEW of Sprint 4 – Owen Huston – Sprint-4-CameraManager by Owen Tishenkel 11/12/21:
Flag: Changes the keyboard.lockInput to GetLockInput() which is just an all around 
improvement, no issues

Camera:Vastly simplifys camera code to not handle more than one camera at once and to 
follow any type of game object, could use one or two comments but otherwise fine. 

CameraManager: Handles multiple cameras allowing for splitscreen, plenty of comments, no issues

CReset: updated to reset Camera Manager and Keyboard Manager, no issues

EnemyController: Added Lock input and getter and setter for it, no issues

KeyboardController: No longer a singleton and getters and setters for lock input

PlayerKeyboardManager: Singleton that Creates and manages keyboards, could use comments 
explaining methods no issues with actual code

Rest of changes: just modifying the rest of the code to work with the new camera manager and 
keyboard manager, no issues

Overall: Some files could use more comments, but most of the changes are just improving code 
quality and are great
