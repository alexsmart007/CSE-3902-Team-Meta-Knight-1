CODE REVIEW of Sprint-5  "Fixed ItemBlock Bug" by Alex Contreras 12/3/21:

BrickBlock: Greatly simplified BrickBlock, great readability with the taking out of the checking of the block, 
given any block in this class will be a brick block, good move.

Fixing the bug by just adding a hit boolean is elegant and simple. Maybe there's a better way, but this seems 
like the perfect fix to me.

Star,mushroom,coin block: All these classes seem to be just ulitizing the hit boolean like the brickblock so 
everything seems good here.

Good use of comments to let the reader know what your code is doing even if it's fairly simple, good increase 
of readability and of maintainability for the future

Overall: Great fix and excellent code
