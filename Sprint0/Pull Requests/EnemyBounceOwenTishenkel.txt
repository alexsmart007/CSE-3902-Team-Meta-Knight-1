CODE REVIEW of Sprint 4 – Alex Contreras – Sprint-4-Enemy-Bounce by Owen Tishenkel 11/5/21:

CollisionData.xml: Switching all the blocks that should be dynamic to dynamic, 
no issues

CDamageEnemy: odd spelling for Enemy enemyRefernce, should probably be 
enemyReference, but otherwise fine

CMarioBounce: Calls Mario to do the actual bouncing, no issues.

CNothing and CRemoveObject: removes unnecessary using Microsoft.Xna.Framework, no 
issues

Enemy and Projectile: throw NotImplementedException() when mario bounce is called, 
should probably remove that and place a comment there saying it should do nothing, 
but I suppose it will only come about through a glitch and we should know about that 
if it happens. So no real issues, but maybe leave a comment in there to explain why 
its there

IMarioState: adding mario bounce, no issues

LevelData.xml: updating needed blocks to be dynamic, no issues

Mario: calls mario bounce with it’s state, no issues

AttackMario: has empty mario bounce method, with no comment explaining why, should 
add a comment but otherwise no issues

Mario States LeftFacing Jumping,moving, and right facing jumping, moving, 
static: no issues, uses 12f as velocity

Mario State left facing static: uses 10f for some reason, should be consistent with 
the rest

Mario Bounce: Only issues I have with this functionality is that MarioLeftFacingStatic 
bounces only -10f compared to every other Mario’s -12f, 
including MarioRightFacingStatic, and throw new NotImplementedException()’s in enemy 
and projectile for mario bounce, they should be empty with a comment saying they 
don’t do anything, not throw an exception.

OVERALL: Only minor issues, but should be fine to merge, just fix the issues I have 
with it
