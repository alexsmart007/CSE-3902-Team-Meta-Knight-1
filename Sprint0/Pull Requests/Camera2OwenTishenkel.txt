CODE REVIEW of Sprint-5-Camera2 by Owen Tishenkel 12/1/21:

CameraLevel1: Our original camera, good at what it does, all this really does is rename it, no issues.

CameraLevel2: Camera 1 but it doesn’t follow the player back down when they jump above a certain amount, 
it plus the kill below a certain level lends difficulty to vertical mario, good but makes it a bit too difficult, 
implementing Alex’s suggestion from the meeting to have it update to have mario’s y level when he lands on a block 
as the new limit would make it easier while maintaining the difficulty. Same quality as level 1’s camera with only 
minor changes, also the kill mario if below a certain y-level code is very nice, good amount of comments, no issues
Camera Manager: Changes revolve around the addition of more than 1 type of camera, methods that create each camera 
and stripping out of the multiple camera code. Streamlines Camera Manager and probably a wise decision not to make 
a single method that creates different camera’s based on input, as we tend to know which type of camera we need and 
only need specific ones at specific times. Could use more comments, i.e. one job comments, for each method but otherwise 

good
Cinematic Camera: Follows mario without doing anything fancy, requires a lot less code than the rest so it makes sense 
that it’s the shortest. Good quality, simple enough that every bit of code is self-explanatory.

Mario:Swapping location of kill mario if below camera to specifically be in camera level 2 makes sense as it make the 
camera less likely to murder the player if it ever messes up with the cinematic or level 1 camera, and the killboxes 
already handle killing in level 1, only strips out code that is placed somewhere else so no issues.
