CODE REVIEW of Sprint 4 â€“ Owen Tishenkel- Sprint-4-Kaejot-Coin by Leon Cai 11/12/21:
CResetGame.cs: Specific reset for HUD. The class itself is well organized and functinally 
correct, but there exists a reset command class already. Either combine these two command 
classes in one or make them functionally independent.

HUD.cs: Implement new features in IHUD. One thing I notice is changing "coinCount = initialCoinCount;" 
to use "ResetCoin();" class reduce the difficulty to maintain the HUD.cs class and easier for 
reader to know what the code does.

IHUD.cs: Added more abstract classes for coins

Item.cs: Add the feature that as 100 coins collected, add one life to Mario.

GameUtilities.cs: Add some constant here to eliminate magic numbers.

Overall: Good Job!
