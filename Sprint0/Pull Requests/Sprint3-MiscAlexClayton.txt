CODE REVIEW of Sprint-3-Misc by Alex Clayton 10/22/21:
ControllerLoader: Great way to data drive this. Copies the other
ideas used with level loading and collision handling.
Everything looks good.

KeyboardBindings.xml: Looks good. Very readable, and easily extendable with good maintainability as you only need to change a single letter to change key binds. In the future, having the player choose the keybind will be easy.

Enemy.cs: Replaces the controller being owned
by Game0 to being owned by ControllerLoader

Game0: Cleaned up everything
Mario.cs:  Looks good. Simple and easy to understand.
