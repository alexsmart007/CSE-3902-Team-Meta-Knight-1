CODE REVIEW OF Sprint-5-Owen by Leon Cai 12/3 2021
DateSheet.json: adjusting mario sprites so it is more similar to real Mario game when Mario takes damage.

CDamageEnemy.cs: Changing from only Mario collide with enemy to both Mario and shell(enemy) can collide with enemy 
to do damage by using if else conditions. Looks good to me.

Enemy.cs: In Enemy.cs class, instead of setting facing direction in each moveRight(), moveLeft() method, The direction 
issue handles by setDirection method which reduces duplicate code. The payoff is that in enemy state classes, we need to 
call the enemy class to set the direction.

HammerBroNormalState.cs: Good job! I really like the way setting the waitingtime of throwing hammer to become random 
which makes the game more challenging. Also, without using the enemy AI, in the update(), it is smart to keep track of 
Mario position to determine the face direction of the enemy.

LevelFactory.cs: Using a new method SpawnObject instead of directly doing it in the body enhances the readabiliy. 
Because new feature spawning objects along the y axis is added, having a method to create object can reduce duplicate 
code. Good job!
