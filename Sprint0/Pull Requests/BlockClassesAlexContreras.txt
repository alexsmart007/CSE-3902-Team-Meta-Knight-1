CODE REVIEW of Sprint 2 by Alex Contreras 9/22/21:
Block: Good idea to have the block class handle all the calls from all the different blocks we need to implement. Good de-coupling as well as abstraction here. A similar thing can be done for the enemies and items! Though a state machine would be needed for the enemies, items, and blocks later on. For what we want in this sprint 2, this should suffice. Good commenting throughout, especially with the call to sprite factory.

Block1State/Block2State/Block3State: Great implementation, however, we're going to need more than 3 blocks, from what I counted on the demo, we should need 9 blocks. But that's an easy addition just a lot of copying and pasting, but just noting it here.

IBlock: We might need an additional method to trigger a change in state if we want environmental interaction, but for now it should be good.

OVERALL: Overall the code seems to be good, no major issues here, obv. we won't know if everything will work until the sprite factory is up and running, but a good shell for the blocks for now.
