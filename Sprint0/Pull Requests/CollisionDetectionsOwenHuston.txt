CODE REVIEW of Sprint-3-Kaejot-Collisions by Owen Huston 10/18/21:

CCollide: This is a good file to have since our game object manager class is already becoming long and has 
alot of other responsibilities

GameObjectManager: The detect collision method has a hard coded rectangle that will have to be changed in the 
future otherwise this works good for now

OVERALL: this seems like a good start for collision detection
