CODE REVIEW of Sprint-3” Fix Camera issue, by running everything off an instance “ by Alex Clayton 10/23/21:
CReset: Added whitespace

Game0: Camera is now owned by game0 rather than Mario owning camera. Sustainable for now, 
but for the future we may have to make it an array if we want to change

Mario: Remove mario owning camera

Program: Best fix we could possible. Game0.Instance.run() instead of Game0.run(). 
Fixes us having two layers of the game at the same time. Maintainable.  Big brain.

Overall: Great
