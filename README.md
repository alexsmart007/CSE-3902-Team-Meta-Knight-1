**ZOOM MEETING**

Meeting1 9/13/21       https://osu.zoom.us/rec/play/aMc50H_YmbxinDd-saoUFqyj4CqbS6AcwKteE9o-dHUz0gTfZ8QloFrWEkU1QFjmhltVUWHiObJtnUK1.6sEX2RksvbyEzEwg?autoplay=true&startTime=1631584920000

In this initial meeting, we first focused on finalizing some of the tasks that we had not completed for sprint 1 yet. First, we set up a trello board for the group, adding columns that represented steps in the Agile development cycle, and adding everyone to it. Then, we finished setting up the GitHub repository and pushing one team member's sprint 0 code as a code base, and got everyone connected with individual branches for working on sprint 2. We also briefly discussed how we would go about meeting regularly, noting how almost all team members are able to do a brief in-person scrum meeting after class, and we would also most likely have a weekly, more long form zoom meeting, especially at the start of sprints.
 Now that the tasks for sprint 1 were complete and everyone had the capability to begin working, we went over the requirements and tasks for sprint 2 and began to fill out cards on the trello board. We then began to discuss what tasks were most important or could be grouped together due to similarities, and began to add labels for the highest priority tasks that could block other tasks from happening. After all the tasks were on the board, we began to assign teammates to all of the tasks, distributing tasks evenly and trying to work with people's strengths to maximize efficiency. We tried to have two team members per task, so if a teammate was stuck or confused they would be able to reach out to their teammate for help. Another point of discussion was how we would go about code review, where we decided that having a rotation system so nobody is stuck looking at one members code consistently would be a good idea to avoid gaps in knowledge that may lead to bugs if one member consistently overlooks something, a code review channel was also created in the team discord server. Before leaving, we decided on a few, higher priority tasks that should be done by our next scrum meeting on wednesday, and set their dates on the trello board.
